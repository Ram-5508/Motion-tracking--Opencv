# Motion-tracking--Opencv

Here the movement in camera is detected using opencv packages. Basically it works by finding out the difference between the first and the next frame. Absolute difference function is used to find the difference between the images. Then various process have be done to find the exact position of the moving object.

I have used in this program in the video given to detect the movement of the cars. This program can be used in place of static camera
